9
​
10
  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
11
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
12
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
13
​
14
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
15
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
16
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
17
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
18
software for all its users.
19
​
20
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
21
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
22
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
23
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
24
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
25
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
26
​
27
  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
28
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
29
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
30
and/or modify the software.
31
​
32
  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
33
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
34
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
35
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
36
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
37
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
38
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
39
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
40
source code to the public.
41
​
42
  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
43
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
44
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
45
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
46
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
47
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
48
code of the modified version.
